discrete time element controller, periodic function    
- tested in contemporary desktop versions of Chrome, Edge, Explorer, Safari, and Firefox  
- open the periodic_controller.html file in a browser  
- a periodic function generates coordinates for the orbiting element  
- after the automated box movement stops, drag the black, red, or green box across the window 
- each control box has a different effect on the sinusoid function 
- mouse events on the boxes initiate the addition of different periodic functions to the discrete signal;   
  and initiate changes to the frequency, phase, amplitude and vertical position  
- the magnitude of effect is directly proportional to the relative position of the target box as a percentage of the total 
  width or height of the browser window
- if a box is at the top left of the window the x scale, y scale and corresponding effect are at 0%; if a box is at 
  the bottom right of the window the x scale, y scale and corresponding effect are at 100% 
- if a box is at the bottom left of the window, the x scale and corresponding effect are at 0%; and the y scale  
  and corresponding effect are at 100%
